# Network Access Detector

The project is written in Pytorch using the following backend: Intel i7-9750 @2.6GHz, 16GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060; Windows 10, CUDA 10.1, and PyTorch 1.0.1.

## NetCess2025

NetCess2025 is a carefully designed dataset with about 17GB raw network traffic from 4 real-world scenarios. It collects the traffic data of network accessing of 42 different mobile devices models from 9 brands, covering most of the mainstream mobile phones. This dataset comprises approximately 17GB of network traffic, encompassing a broad spectrum of mainstream mobile device brands, including Huawei (8 models), Oppo (6 models), Xiaomi (6 models), Apple (5 models), Vivo (5 models), Meizu (4 models), OnePlus (3 models), Samsung (4 models) and Coolpad (1 model). Each time a device joins the network, the traffic can be automatically captured and recorded as an event (Evt). Four Scenarios are investigated. About 4,400 events are included in $S_A$. More than 4,000 events and 6,800 events are recorded in $S_B$ and $S_C$, respectively. $S_D$, which is not shown in the table, contains only background traffic without the behaviour of network accessing.
